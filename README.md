# Issue-Tracking-System
ITMD 515 - Advanced Software Programming project

Introduction:
I developed an issue tracking system for the final project.

Features:
Multiple organizations can sign up their managers and employees. One or more employees can be added to a Team which is managed by a Manager. These team-members can then create and dispatch tickets to different teams and collaborate to resolve related issues.
Each ticket can be assigned a priority, which in turn decides the SLA.

Technology used :
Java 8, JPA, hibernate, JavaServer Faces, MySQL.
